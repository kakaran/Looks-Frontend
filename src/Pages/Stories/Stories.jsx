                I explained that I wanted to donate my hair,and promised to
                cry. She made great suggestions and quickly got down to
                business. Despite tears,she was kind and patient and I got a
                great,fun cut ... I've been to the solon before for other
                services-amassage ,manicure/pedicure, which were all pleasant
                experiences. It'sacool salon without pretension.Their prices are
                very reasonable and everyone is friendly and professional.
